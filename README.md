# Turn based game.
My game is turn based which means we and pc take turns trying to defeat each other, you can attack with your weapon, block, heal or use magic to defeat your enemy.	 
I have used SFML to create all graphic related things in this game.  
You will need SFML 2.6.1, C++ version 17 and c_make version 3.26.  
  
After you run the game, you will see the main menu, in menu you choose your character proffesion.  
if you want to play as a warrior you should click "1", if you want to play as an archer you should click "2", or if you want to play as a mage you should click "3".  
During fight, your enemy will have random proffesion chosen for him.  
  
Controls during fight:  
Mouse Left Buuton: Basic Attack. Basic Attack deals damage based on your attack and your enemy lowers it with his armor.  
Mouse Right Button: Heal. Heal recovers 10 Health Points, and costs 5 Mana Points.  
Mouse Button Scroll: Defend. Defend lets you raise your armor and magic resist untill the begining of next turn.  
Mouse Button XButton1: Spell. Spell deal 10 damage and it's damage is lowered by magic resist. Spell costs 5 Mana Points.
